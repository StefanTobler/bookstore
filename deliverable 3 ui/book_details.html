              <p class="book-summary ml-4 mr-4">This book focuses on the principles, processes and decisions made during the development of the C++ programming language. As the inventor of the language, Stroustrup presents his insight into the decisions which resulted in the features of C++ - the praised, the controversial and even some of the rejected ones. By writing this book the author presents his object-oriented programming philosophy to the interested programming community. His vehicle is the C++ language but his focus is on real object-oriented programming language development for the working programmer rather than as a abstract approach to the OOP paradigm.</p>
